# Table Tales
This repository contains the source code for **Table Tales**, a digital product developed for a real client, Scapino Ballet. The project aims to engage a younger and more diverse audience through an interactive multi-device dance performance.

## Overview
Table Tales transforms a typical café experience by introducing QR codes on tables, accompanied by flyers with more information. Upon scanning the QR code, users are guided to an interactive website where they participate in a unique dance performance. The concept encourages group interaction and discussion as they explore various dancer stories.

### How It Works
1. **Scan QR Code**: Users scan the QR code at their café table to open the interactive website.
2. **Follow Instructions**: Users place their phones on the table and connect them by pinching the sides of the screens that are touching.
3. **Choose a Dancer**: Each screen displays a different dancer and their story. The group discusses and selects which dancer to watch.
4. **Experience the Dance**: The performance begins, with the dancer telling their story through movement across screens. At key moments, the story pauses, and different emotions are displayed. The group then discusses their reactions and chooses how the story progresses.
5. **Conclusion**: The performance ends with a summary screen, showcasing the experiences of the group and inviting them to attend Scapino Ballet.
